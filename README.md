The Uber Insight app's main function is to provide an earner with insights into their past trips. It achieves this by analyzing past data and giving a result in the form of both text and graph.
The Uber Insight app contains three main elements, namely: The tab selection, the user id selection, and the possible filtering selection. Firstly the user is required to insert a user id into the user id search bar.
After that the application will proceed to incorporate this given user id to formulate a result.
There are four tabs, three of these are to see the average earnings for a specific condition. These are: weather, city and distance.
The fourth tab allows the user to apply filters to the data of the previous trips to try and see different combinations of conditions and see what their respective earnings have been.
The filters are implemented using a dropdown menu, where each option is listed per condition. It also includes a '-' to specify that no option has been selected.
